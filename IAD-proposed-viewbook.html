	<br> <br> <br> <br>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">In hopes of gaining experience meshing marketing with design, a group of students at the Institute of Art and Design at New England College put together a viewbook for their school. While the viewbook was never released, this multidisciplinary artist collaboration crafted a student-designed viewbook that spoke for the school from a unique insider perspective. Some of the sections in this draft included a Welcome page with the school Mission and Vision Statements, Campus Life, Programs of Study, Facilites, Application and Porfolio Crafting Page, a Faculty section, Campus Map and others. The pages included below are merely the pages Hannah designed, as work was spread evenly among all group members.</p>
			 
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Working on the Campus Map, Facilities section, Alumni Work section, Portfolio Spread, and two of the Programs of Study, Hannah collaborated with the other students to form a branding guide to establish consistency throughout the viewbook. The campus map being a recreation of a previously printed map by the university was not uniquely designed by Hannah, but included minor moderations to renew the map.</p>

	<br><br><br>
			 
	<p style="margin-left: 240px;; margin-right: 200px;">On the Facilites spread, as each spread was its own facility, Hannah added a type-stacked background spelling "FACILITIES" to add continuity to the section as a whole. Highlighting various locations on campus that made IAD at NEC unique, this section was designed with hopes to draw incoming students to the campus based on the current student appreciation for these spaces.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 240px;; margin-right: 200px;">Like the facilities section, the Programs of Study section was diverse and vast. Using the text-stacking method, Hannah separated each major from each other by labeling "GRAPHIC DESIGN" for the background text for the Graphic Design spreads, and so on. Each major receiving 2 spreads (4 pages total) of real estate, this provided space for a brief desciption of the major paired with a process image on one spread, showing students engaged in work for that major. On the following spread, finished work by a student or alumni who studied that major would be paired with a quote about their experience studying that program of study at IAD. This provided consistency among all the majors while providing viewers with a personal experience spelled out for each major, connecting them with the program.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 240px;; margin-right: 200px;">To inspire incoming students with past artwork students have created, the group of students wanted to dedicate one section to IAD alumns. Gathering work from a variety of majors, Hannah grouped photos of these works together to encourage students to join any discipline at the university.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 240px;; margin-right: 200px;">Lastly, Hannah put together a "How to Create Your College Portfolio page for incoming students. Something she did not know much about when applying to colleges, she believed this would be a helpful tool to all incoming students who may not know what to put in their portfolio. By providing simple pointers in an organized layout, the goal was to make this page as easy to navigate as possible, trying to provide help without overwhelming applicants. Also using pictograms to align with each step in the porfolio creating process, these were added to create a welcoming atmosphere.</p>
