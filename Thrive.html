	<br> <br> <br> <br>
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Thrive is an up and coming plant care company that was looking for branding identity and app design. With the mission to "provide simple and accessible plant care for everyone," this company was looking for a playful aesthetic with earth tone colors meshing with user-friendly navigation.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">In crafting the Thrive logo, Hannah wanted something that represented the nature of the company name; embodying success, and fruitful life as a plant. Using the logo seein to the left, this design balanced playfulness with minor abstractions to the letter forms with polished legibility, providing the desired company feel. Using linework coming off the letters “T” and “e,” she aimed to make the logo feel plant-like, as if it is in the process of growing to its full potential.</p>
		
	<img class="QR-code" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;" width="15%" alt="QR-Code" src="Images/HSchlim-QR Code.png">
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Concerning app design, Hannah used the Thrive aesthetic to create a welcoming environment for consumers in a phone application. In an effort to make plant care attainable to all users, Thrive utilizes various components for success. Using reminders under the “Care Tracker” program, customers can view what their plants require each day, and can check off each task when completed. The users also have access to detailed care tips about each of their plants under the My Greenhouse screen, allowing them to know their preferences for water, sunlight, and more. If users are wishing to buy new plants, the shop section allows consumers to purchase plants, as well as view informative care information, to allow users to feel that they are getting the best plant for their garden. Consumers can also purchase gardening supplies from the shop section to get a jump start to their plant care journey. Additionally, if users have questions about their plant, or wish to share their gardening experience with others, the Bloom Blog screen offers a social media aspect where consumers can interact with each other within the Thrive app. With these tools used throughout the app, Thrive works to equip users with best-practice strategies to feel confident and encouraged to keep their plant healthy. Scan the QR code here to explore the app simulation Hannah created. Feel free to leave a comment with suggestions, questions, or compliments by tapping the speech bubble icon at the bottom center of the screen.</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">In addition to branding and app design, Hannah designed several pieces of promotional material for Thrive. This included an animated video advertisement and a poster to highlight the app functionality and welcoming design of the Thrive app with the goals of educating users about their plants. *Note the downward pointing arrow was used to reference the QR Code when displayed in a gallery setting*</p>
		
		<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">Thrive branded stickers were also created to promote the brand. These stickers are 3" in diameter, and can be purchased in the shop on the Thrive app under "Thrive Merch."</p>
