	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">A small jewelry business, Crystalized Whimsy was looking for app and branding design to kick off their company. <img style="float: right; margin-right: 40px; margin-left: 20px;" src="Images/CW-logo.jpg" width="13%" alt="CW-logo">Crafting rings, necklaces, and bracelets out of gem stones, crystals, and wire, this creator was looking for a playful design with a moody color palette. Aftering seeing how the client wrapped each crystal or gemstone in circular cord of wire to secure it to each ring, this became the inspiration for her logo.</p>
		
	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Following this same color scheme and whimsical aesthetic, Hannah designed the app for shopping purposes and experimenting with DIY design for consumers. The shop featuring selectons of rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and jewelry sets was organized based on category with simple icons for each piece jewelry for easier navigation. Within the "Explore" or DIY design section, customers are welcomed to select the type of wire for their jewelery and select which color gemstone or crystal they would like to pair it with. Additonally, they are able to select what style of jewelry (earrings or a ring) they would like to create. This variety of options allows users to feel that they are playing a part in the jewelry making process, personalizing their item.</p>
