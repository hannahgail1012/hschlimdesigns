In her work, she aims to combine this love of dynamic typography with organic shapes, and a clean, organized layout. With experience designing for clients ranging from a jewelry company to a music festival, her style is malleable, to allowing success for a wide variety of clients. Her current work focuses on promotional material and app design for a plant company dedicated to providing simple, accessible plant care for everyone.</p>
