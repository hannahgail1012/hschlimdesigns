	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Mountain Air Brewery was looking for branding and can design for their beer company. Beginning the logo design process, Hannah started with research and a mood board for the desired company aesthetic. Combining typefaces with color and texture alignment to the brand, this unified the feel of the logo for this business.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">A line of beers targeted towards backpackers and long-distance hikers, Mountain Air creates craft beer to would simulate the experience of reaching the peak of mountain and taking in the fresh, mountain air. Whether sipping an "M.A." beer on the top of a peak with your friends, or enjoying a cold drink on your couch, Mountain Air provides canned mountain nostalgia wherever you go. Creating three product variations based on seasons, this resulted in an Original Summertime Crisp June Lager, an Autumn Breeze Amber Ale, and a Winter Tundra Dark Stout. Using illustrative details along the cans based on seasonal happenings, as well as color coding each can with a central banner, and band around the top and bottom edges Hannah provides disinction between products based on seasonal attributes.</p>
